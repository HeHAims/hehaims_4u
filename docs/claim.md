# Falsifiable Claim

Changing only grammatical modality (e.g., "might" vs. "must") systematically changes perceived certainty, independent of content.

## Prediction
- Sentences with "must" will be rated as more certain.
- Sentences with "might" will be rated as less certain.

## Why this matters
This supports the idea that grammar directly modulates belief certainty and affective intensity, not just semantic content. The claim can be tested without access to the full CMIS engine.
