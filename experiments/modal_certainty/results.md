## Modal Certainty - Initial Results

Sentence: "This pizza might be bad."
Certainty ratings: 6, 8

Sentence: "This pizza must be bad."
Certainty ratings: 8, 10

Observation:
Across runs, sentences using "must" were rated as more certain than those using "might".

## Next Steps
- Expand stimuli: add more modals ("may," "could," "should") and normalize sentence frames before rating.
- Normalize ratings: track rater IDs and timing, then compute paired comparisons to reduce noise.
- Policy linkage: map certainty deltas to tentative policy weights for downstream CMIS/Will layers once sample size increases.
